The scripts in this directory have been created for demonstrations associated with the presentation ["Getting Around to It: Deferred Work Mechanisms in the Linux Kernel"](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/21x/presentations/getting-around-it-deferred-work-mechanisms-linux-kernel).   They have been tested with bpftrace v0.19.0 plus Debian unstable and [experimental](https://github.com/chaiken/linux/tree/wq-dump) kernels which are current in early 2024.  More information about the kernel configuration and other software tools is linked in the presentation slides in [ODP format](http://she-devel.cobbm/ChaikenSCALE2024.odp) and  [PDF format](http://she-devel.com/ChaikenSCALE2024.pdf).   The [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH5ecVVlbcM) starts at 18:20 into the linked recording.  Note that the website URLs genuinely are http rather than https.   The program *classify_process_affinity* demonstrated during the presentation is available from a [different repo](https://github.com/chaiken/util-scripts).
