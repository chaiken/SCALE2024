The scripts in this directory have been created for demonstrations associated with the presentation ["Getting Around to It: Deferred Work Mechanisms in the Linux Kernel"](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/21x/presentations/getting-around-it-deferred-work-mechanisms-linux-kernel).   They have been tested with bpftrace v0.19.0 plus Debian unstable and experimental kernels which are current in early 2024.  No warranty is offered or implied.   A link to associated slides and video will eventually appear at [she-devel.com](http://she-devel.com), which does not have an https version because I am cheap.
